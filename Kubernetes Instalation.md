# Kubernetes Installation

## Kubernetes
- **Paid services:** Google Cloud or AWS services.
- **Free services:** Minikube. It will just create a single node cluster on your computer, happening that single node will be a worker node and a master node

## Virtual Machinne or Container manager
You have many options to select one:
- VirtualBox (For MAC users)
- VMware
- Docker (It will run Kubernetes on a container)
  - This one is not recommended because there are some inconvinients using it.
- Hyper-V (For Windows users)
- Parallels

## Kubectl
It comes included with **Minikube** but if you want to use SSH you have to enter minikube kubectl commands, being inconvinient therefore it is recommended to install kubectl separatedly, having the advantge of managing other Kubernets clusters, which can be located at , for example, AWS.

## Viusual Studio Code Editor
This is for the coding done in the tutorial. You can install the Kubernetes extension for the files, deployments, etc.
